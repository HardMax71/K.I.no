# Movie Attendance Prediction ðŸŽ¥

### So what is this about?
Choosing the right movies to show is not always easy, especially while trying to keep a good balance in the programm. Should you settle for Arthouse Movie 'X' or 'Y'? While deciding this, you should probably have the attendance in mind. Not as the main factor of course, but what good is it to screen the best Underground Movie ever if nobody shows up?

Models like this could also give reasons as to why some movies perform more poorly than others, - and how to change marketing to get more people to see the Arthouse Pearl you have in mind!
A model like this is not supposed to work universaly but rather trained and used by specific cinemas.

### _But why?_
To be honest, this project and subsequently this repository are more for learning purposes than anything else. Best case, this project will end with a model that can reliably predict the attendance of a movie.
Worst case, i learned something. I'm hoping for something in between lol.

### How will it work?
I'm not set on a special Machine Learning Algorithm yet, but there are definetly some i want to try out!
- Linear Regression
- Multiple Regression
- Support Vector Machine 
- Some kind of Pipeline (Random Forest +...+ etc.)
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- Some kind of Neural Network (?)

At the end i will probably settle for some kind of Pipeline, but who knows.


### Big shoutout to the Cine-Asta Trier!
They provided the data i will use to train the model! The model will also only work for the cinema who provided the data, which in this case is them âœ¨
